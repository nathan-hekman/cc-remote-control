# cc-imessage-remote-control — product context

## Register

**brand** — the README is the primary marketing surface (logo, hero,
tagline). Social card is the secondary surface (OG/Twitter unfurl).
Design IS the product on those surfaces; the INSTALL/SECURITY docs are
deeper-dive secondary material.

## Users

Developers on **Claude Code Pro/Max plans** who:
- Code on a Mac (macOS 14+)
- Use an iPhone signed into the same iCloud as the Mac
- Want to spin up Claude Code Remote Control sessions from anywhere with
  cell signal — couch, airport, trail — without physically being at the Mac
- Care about privacy. They will not grant Full Disk Access to a third-party
  app to read their iMessage history just to get a remote-trigger feature.

Persona snapshot: solo indie devs, side-project hackers, and shipping-fast
founders. Comfortable with terminals, picky about clean install flows,
allergic to vendor lock-in and "give us access to everything" permission
asks.

## Product purpose

**Kick off Claude Code from iMessage. Keep your chat history yours.**

A native macOS Shortcut catches one keyword (your project name) and
launches `claude --remote-control` on the Mac. You then drive the
session from the iOS Claude app. Claude never sees a message it
wasn't explicitly addressed in.

Existing path required physically being at the Mac to start the
session. This bridge removes that step using **native macOS Shortcuts**
as the trigger gate — no `chat.db` slurp like BlueBubbles or
Anthropic's official iMessage MCP integration require.

## Brand

- **Tone:** upbeat-but-calm. "Yeah, this one's nice." Not rocket-and-
  confetti SaaS holler.
- **Voice:** ELI8 plain words. A twelve-year-old should grok every
  sentence on the landing page.
- **Surfer cadence** allowed (chill, friendly), but never goofy.
- No exclamation marks anywhere. No emoji anywhere.
- One sentence per bullet. One idea per sentence.
- Lead with privacy in every reframe.

## Anti-references

What this landing page must **not** look or sound like:

- **SaaS-rocket-confetti landing pages**: gradient buttons, "10x your
  workflow", testimonial carousels, "Get started free" CTAs that lead
  to a paywall.
- **Cypherpunk-edgy security tools**: black-and-neon, terminal-only
  aesthetics, scary jargon. We're privacy-forward without being
  paranoid.
- **BlueBubbles-style "trust us with your whole iMessage history"
  vibe**: long permission lists, screenshots of TCC dialogs as
  features. Our pitch is the opposite.
- **Default-Tailwind documentation sites**: gray/indigo, sidebar nav,
  H1 + H2 + paragraph pattern every section. Generic open-source vibe.
- **Anthropic / Claude product chrome**: don't ape the official
  marketing aesthetic — this is a community plugin, not first-party.

## Strategic principles

1. **Privacy is the lead pitch.** Every other "iMessage for Claude"
   bridge reads `chat.db`. We don't. This isn't a feature buried in the
   FAQ — it's the headline.
2. **Native is the moat.** macOS Shortcuts is a known, trusted, Apple-
   first-party surface. Use that recognition in the visual language.
3. **Install must look turnkey.** Two `claude plugin` commands +
   `/cc-imessage setup`. Show that, prominently, near the top.
4. **No exaggeration.** The remote-driving experience itself is a
   Claude Code feature — we're the doorbell that wakes it up. Don't
   over-claim. Don't oversell.
5. **Friendly without being childish.** The TiVo-inspired logo and the
   "text yourself, keep your chat history" framing are warm; the docs
   are precise. Don't let either drift toward the other.

## Surfaces

- `README.md` — primary marketing surface. Logo + hero + tagline.
  Snappy and short; depth lives in INSTALL/SECURITY.
- `docs/assets/social-card.html` → `social-card.png` — Open Graph /
  Twitter unfurl image (1200×630).
- `docs/assets/logo-mark.svg` + `.png` — brand mark (two CC letters +
  adaptive smile). The smile is dark on light backgrounds, light on
  dark — via `prefers-color-scheme` inside the SVG.
- `docs/assets/hero-flow-v2.png` — the iMessage → Mac → iOS-Claude
  flow image embedded in the README.
